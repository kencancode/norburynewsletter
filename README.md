Because I worked as an email marketer in the past, MailChimp and I were (are) best friends. 

Recently, I took some time to learn more about MailChimp API and deployment using Heroku. I created this full-stack web application for anyone who wishes to sign up...to nothing. Well, after a few minutes, you'll receive a subjectively, minimalistically beautiful test email that I built (within minutes)...just to make sure it works!
